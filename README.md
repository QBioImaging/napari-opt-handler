## üõÄ Usage

### üèÅ Starting point
1. Data input streamed from ImSwitch OPT widget (for details see [ImSwitch docs])
2. Loaded tomography projections as data stack
3. Other stack 3D volume data formats
4. Small example data loaded via `File -> Open Sample`

### üåç Global settings
Two important global settings are available: **Inplace operations** and **Tracking**.

To save memory, default mode performs operations on the image stack **Inplace**, rewriting the original image stack. If this option is not selected, a new layer with the modified version of the image will be created and added to the viewer.
When **Inplace operations** is selected, the **Tracking** option becomes available in the widget. This option allows tracking of the last operation performed on the stack/image. By pressing the `Undo` button, the last operation performed on the image is reverted. Only **single undo** is possible.

Currently, images are kept or casted to `numpy.int16` after the operations, except for the `-log` calculation. We strongly recommend to perform the operation in top to bottom and left to right order, as they appear in the widget, otherwise there is a high chance of running into exceptions or unpredictable behavior. Please [file an issue], if some of the widget logic should be fixed for your pipelines.

### üåûüåö Transmission vs Emission
Transmission experiments are envisioned to be quantitative in the approximation of the Beer-Lambert law, this means that using the bright and dark measurement one can calculate the *absorbance*, or rather *transmittance* as

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}\bg{white}&space;T=-\log\left(\frac{I-I_0}{I_0-I_d}\right)" />

, where I is the measured signal, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}\bg{white}&space;I_0" /> is the bright field intensity and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{110}\bg{white}&space;I_d" /> are the dark counts.

Emission is typically far from quantitative, because of unknown staining concentration, quenching effects, bleaching, detection path calibration, quantum yields, to name some.

### üì∑ Corrections
Dark-field, Bright-field and Bad-pixel corrections are directly related to the camera acquisition. Intensity correction deals on the other hand with the instability of the light source.
The corrected image is shown in the viewer using the original image contrast limits. You may need to adjust the contrast limits to effectively see the result of the performed correction.

#### Dark-field and Bright-field correction
Combinations of Dark-field and Bright-field corrections are possible for both transmission and emission experiments.
The user must select the experiment modality and then decide whether to include only one correction (either Dark-field or Bright-field) or both. Once the correction is completed, depending on the **Inplace** setting, either a new layer with the corrected image will appear in the viewer, or the original image layer will be updated.
**Dark-field correction** alone performs subtraction of the *dark* (`int` operation) image from each image in the image stack, it is always worth applying it. This operation is the same regardless of *Transmission* or *Emission* experimental modality.

**Bright-field correction** is particularly useful for transmission experiments, to correct varying intensity of the bright background of the images. The *bright* layer can also be used to identify dead pixels. If applied alone, images are divided by bright intensity (`float` division) and then converted to `numpy.int16` for the case of *Transmission* experiment. For *Emission* data, bright field intensity is subtracted from the each image in the stack (`int` operation).

**Dark + Bright field correction** performed together is calculated for *Transmission*
```
(image - dark) / (bright - dark)
```
, which is `float` operation, casted subsequently to `numpy.int16`.

For the *Emission* data, the combined dark and bright correction applied to *Emission* experiment is simply

```
(image - dark) - (bright - dark) = image - bright
```

See section [above](#-transmission-vs-emission) for additional explanation on difference between transmission and emission.


#### Bad-pixel correction
Pixel correction is available for both hot pixels and dead pixels. Once the `Bad pixel correction` button is pressed, bad pixels are identified, and the user can choose to either correct them or visualize them as a new layer in the viewer.

<img src="https://github.com/QBioImaging/napari-opt-handler/blob/main/doc_images/bad_pixel.png" width="500"/>

Correction is performed by considering the values of neighboring pixels. Two options are available for correction: n4 and n8. The n4 option uses the 4 neighboring pixels (up, down, left, and right), while the n8 option considers all 8 neighboring pixels. If a neighboring pixel is a bad pixel itself, it is not considered for correction. The bad pixel value is calculated as `mean` of the neighboring pixel values.

#### Intensity correction
Once Dark-field, Bright-field and Bad pixels corrections have been applied, it is possible to apply an **Intensity correction** to correct light inhomogeneities along the stack generated by the instability of the illumination source.
The user chooses the rectangle size and presses the `Intensity correction` button. The average of the pixels in four corners of the image (with side equal to the rectangle size) will be calculated over the stack and a corrected image will appear in the viewer (if the Inplace operations option is not selected) or the original image will be updated. Additionally, a plot showing the intensities over the stack (`mean` intensity over the 4 rectangular areas of the image) before and after the intensity correction will be shown.

If you want to correct for fluorescence photo-bleaching, see the next [section](#fluorescence-bleaching-correction).

#### Fluorescence Bleaching correction
<a name="sinograms"></a>

<img src="https://github.com/QBioImaging/napari-opt-handler/blob/main/doc_images/bleach_corr.png" width="500"/>

For each angle, the mean intensity values along the columns are calculated and then used as correction factors to divide the intensity values of each row in respect to first projection. Once the correction is done, a plot showing the calculated mean values for each angle appears in the viewer. This feature assumes that the stack is in the form `(angles, rows, columns)`.

Note that this correction does not take care of shadowing effects which are apparent in the sinograms [above](#sinograms), taken from a single camera row.The fluorescence excitation light comes from the right in this case, therefore the right side of sinogams show higher FL intensity.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Other
#### Binning
Binning of the stack is possible. Choose the binning factor and press the `Bin Stack` button. The binned stack will be displayed and a notification with the original and new stack shapes will appear. The shape is `(height // bin_factor, width // bin _factor)`, so edge pixels might be missing if your image dimensions are not devisable by `bin_factor`.  Pixel values are calculated as a `mean` of the binned pixels and casted to `numpy.int16`. Binning factor of 1 results in no action.

#### ROI
For tomography reconstruction, selecting ROI can greatly reduce the computation time of the reconstruction algorithm.
Select a `Points layer` and add a point, which defines upper-left corner of the ROI. From that point `width` and `height` in pixels are selected by the user.
If more than one point is added, only the last point will be considered for ROI selection.

#### -Log
It is possible to calculate the logarithm of the image using the **-Log** function of the widget making details in dark and light areas more visible. This is a physically justified transformation in transmission experiments, because it converts counts to *transmittance*. For *Emission* measurements, it is just a transformation to increase contrast non-linearly for visualization.

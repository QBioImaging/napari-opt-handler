## üõÄ Usage

### üèÅ Starting point
1. Data streamed from ImSwitch OPT widget (see details here[LINK])
2. Loaded images as data stack
3. Other stack 3D volume data formats
4. Small example data loaded via `File -> Open Sample`

### üåç Global settings
Two important global settings are available:**Inplace operations** and **Tracking**. 

If **Inplace operations** is selected,  every operation is performed on the original image. If this option is not selected, a new layer with the modified version of the image will be created and added to the viewer. 

When **Inplace operations** is selected, the **Tracking** option becomes available in the widget. This option allows tracking the operations performed on the image. By pressing the `Undo` button, the last operation performed on the image is removed. 

### üì∑ Corrections
Dark-field, Bright field and Bad-pixel corrections are directly related to the camera acquisition. Intensity correction deals on the other hand with the instability of the light source.
#### Dark-field and Bright-field correction
Combinations of Dark-field and Bright-field corrections are possible for both transmission and emission experiments.
The user must select the experiment modality and then decide if including just one between Dark/Bright-field correction or both. Once the correction is completed, either a new layer with the corrected image will appear in the viewer (if the Inplace operations option is not selected) or the original image layer will be updated (if Inplace operations is selected). 
**Dark-field correction** is always applicable and it is always worth applying it. 
**Bright-field correction** is very useful for transmission experiments and can also be used to identify dead pixels.
#### Bad-pixel correction
Pixel correction is available both for hot pixels and dead pixels. Once the `Bad pixel correction` button is pressed, bad pixels are identified, and the user can choose to either correct them or visualize them as a new layer in the viewer. 
Correction is performed by considering the values of neighboring pixels. Two options are available for correction: n4 and n8. The n4 option uses the 4 neighboring pixels (up, down, left, and right), while the n8 option considers all 8 neighboring pixels. If a neighboring pixel is a bad pixel itself, it is not considered for correction.
#### Intensity correction
Once Dark-field, Bright-field and Bad pixels corrections have been applied, it is possible to apply an **Intensity correction** to correct the light inhomogeneities along the stack generated by the instability of the illumination source.
The user chooses the rectangle size and press the `Intensity correction` button. The average of the pixels in four square regions of the image (with side egual to the rectangle size) will be calculated over the stack and a corrected image will appear in the viewer (if the Inplace operations option is not selected) or the original image will be updated. Moreover, a plot that shows the intensities over the stack before and after the intensity correction will appear.
- If you want to correct for fluorescence photo-bleaching, current version of the plugin does not provide it. Please submit a feature request or upvote an existing one.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Other
#### Binning
Binning of the stack is possible. Choose the binning factor and press the `Bin Stack` button. The binned stack will be displayed and a notification with the original and new stack shapes will appear. If the binning factor is 1 nothing will happen.
#### ROI
Instead of working on the entire image, it is possible to select a region of interest (ROI) and work only with it.
Select a `Points layer` and add a point where you want to select a ROI. The point's coordinates will be the upper left corner of the rectangle of interest with the widht and height decided by the user. 
If more than one point is added, only the last point will be considered for selection of the ROI.
#### -Log
It is possible to calculate the logarithm of the image using the **Log** function of the widget making details in dark and light areas more visible. Actually, -log is computed instead of log.
